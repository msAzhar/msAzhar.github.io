How to speak English?<br>
</blockquote>


Good morning, here is the video below, that reminds how to speak English. When you speak, do not focus on yourself, on your mistakes and on what the person in front of you will think about your "poor" English.. Just be concentrated on your message you want to convey.

When you concentrate on your "Am I mistaken now?", you really start making mistakes.. So, just be confident! Fighting!
